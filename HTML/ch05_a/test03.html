    <h3 id="hate">hate </h3>
    <p>
        All up in my face, you not from the clique
        Give me space, we might rob the shit
        Most hate it, baby they don't love the clique
        I thought they love you when you make it
        This some other shit, yeah
        Yeah, yeah, this some other shit
        Friends and business don't mix so I'm brotherless
        Tryna get back close, hit 'em with the stiff
        Gears I shift, make sure they feel the drift
        Just copped the Benz all with the tint
        You should know cause in every song I said this shit
        Yeah, in every song I said this shit
        I'm just proud of my accomplishments
        I'm a 4Hunnid nigga, I don't care at all
        Have her suck dick, lick the head and all
        Heard you talkin' 'bout I'm real, I'm fraud
        Your kids and broad, they straight, you shouldn't care at all
        Please, please tell me why you always hatin'
        Why you hatin'?
        Please tell me why you always hatin'
        Please, please tell me why you always hatin'
        Why you hatin'?
        Please tell me why you always hatin'
        Please, please tell me why you always hatin'
        Why you hatin'?
        Please tell me why you always hatin'
        Please, please tell me why you always hatin'
        Why you hatin'?
        Please tell me why you always hatin'

    <h3 id="nas"> nas is like</h3>
    <p>
        Freedom or jail, clip's inserted, a baby's being born
        Same time a man is murdered, the beginning and end
        As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
        My plateau, and also, what defines my name
        First it was Nasty, but times have changed
        Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my science for pain
        I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
        Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
        Saw my close friends shot, flatline am I sane?
        That depends, carry Mac-10's to practice my aim
        On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
        Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
        Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads
        To the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough
        To the big dogs living large, taking in light
        Pushing big toys, getting nice, enjoying your life
        Is what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
        Belt tied around their neck in jail cells naked
        Heaven and hell, rap legend, presence is felt
        And of course N-A-S are the letters that spell
        NAS, NAS

    <h3 id="NY">NY state of mind</h3>
    <p>
        Yeah, yeah
        Ayo Black, it's time, word (word, it's time, man)
        It's time, man (a'ight, man, begin)
        Yeah, straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
        Where fake niggas don't make it back
        I don't know how to start this shit, yo, now
        Rappers, I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm
        I be kickin', musician inflictin' composition of pain, I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
        Holdin' an M16, see, with the pen I'm extreme
        Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
        I'm suited up with street clothes, hand me a .9, and I'll defeat foes
        Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
        I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
        Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
        Laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
        G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
        Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
        Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
        Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
        Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
        I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
        Picked the MAC up, told brothers "Back up!", the MAC spit
        Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him back-flip
        Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
        Gave another squeeze, heard it click, "Yo, my shit is stuck!"
